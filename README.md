# MealsMagic  
MealsMagic is an online web application that assists users in locating notable restaurants depending on the categories of meals they provide. Data from the MongoDB database helps users to explore the locations of such notable restaurants and on selecting their preferred meal type, directing them to the appropriate restaurants that are providing the same meals. The MERN stack is used to build the application, which comprises MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js with MVC architecture. Additionally, Postman is also used for testing the API endpoints. 
# Installation 
1. Install the required dependencies: npm install  
2. Set up the MongoDB database and configure the connection settings.
3. Start the application: npm start  
# Usage  
1. **Page 1** - On the Locations page, users can view a list of available locations fetched from the database. Select the desired meal type to render into the next page.  
2. **Page 2**  - The Restaurants page displays a list of restaurants based on the selected meal type.  If a particular restaurant does not provide the selected meal type, a message stating "No records found" will be displayed.  
3. **Page 3** - The Restaurant Details page provides users with comprehensive information about a selected restaurant. It includes a description of the restaurant, its detailed location, contact number, approximate price range, and rating. This information is fetched from the MongoDB database.
