# MealsMagic  
MealsMagic is a web application that helps users identify restaurants based on the meals they provide. With the help of a MongoDB database, users can explore various locations and choose their desired meal type that directs them to display restaurant details. The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Additionally, Postman is used for testing the API endpoints.  
# Installation 
1. Install the required dependencies: npm install  
2. Set up the MongoDB database and configure the connection settings.
3. Start the application: npm start  
# Usage  
1. **Page 1** - On the Locations page, users can view a list of available locations fetched from the database. Select the desired meal type to render into the next page.  
2. **Page 2**  - The Restaurants page displays a list of restaurants based on the selected meal type.  If a particular restaurant does not provide the selected meal type, a message stating "No records found" will be displayed.  
3. **Page 3** - The Restaurant Details page provides users with comprehensive information about a selected restaurant. It includes a description of the restaurant, its detailed location, contact number, approximate price range, and rating. This information is fetched from the MongoDB database.
