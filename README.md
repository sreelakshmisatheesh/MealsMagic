# MealsMagic  
MealsMagic is a web application that helps users identify restaurants based on the meals they provide. With the help of a MongoDB database, users can explore various locations and choose their desired meal type that directs them to display restaurant details. The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Additionally, Postman is used for testing the API endpoints.  
# Installation 
1. Install the required dependencies: npm install  
2. Set up the MongoDB database and configure the connection settings.
3. Start the application: npm start  
# Usage
